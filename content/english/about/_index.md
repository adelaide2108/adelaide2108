I am an environmental scientist from ETH Zurich,  pursuing a PhD about on landscape-level decision-making. My research explores the motivations behind nature restoration—why individuals choose to restore their land and what drives communities to collaborate on restoration efforts. <br><br>
In my free time I love to be outside and spend time with my horse in the woods.
