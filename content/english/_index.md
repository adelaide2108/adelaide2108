    content: "My research explores the reasons behind decision-making in Scotland’s restoration management of different stakeholders.<br><br> In this project, I am developing an agent-based model, grounded in psychological theory, to explore how decisions about nature restoration are made in Scotland. <br><br>***Agent-based modelling*** is a computer-based approach that simulates how individuals or groups behave and interact, helping us understand how their choices shape larger systems. <br><br>  By engaging communities, fostering partnerships, and ensuring knowledge accessibility, I aim to bridge practice and policy —promoting both ecological recovery and social equity"
